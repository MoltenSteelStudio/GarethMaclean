  <p>
    My name is Gareth Maclean, I was born 05-July 1983 in Wales United Kingdom.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    I started showing a keen interest in software development at a very young
    age when i discovered that I could use the spectrum ZX to make my own games
    as a result i started scouring my local library for any information on how
    to do this. I wasn't very old so this was a struggle but as I matured i started
    to get a grasp on it. It was from this moment I was hooked.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    By the age of 11 I was a keen programmer and was confidently making various
    pieces of software (Mostly Games) which gave me a thrill each time one of my
    friends would test it out, it was at this age that I decided that this is what
    I wanted to do when i was older.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    I spent the remaining years in school grasping the core concepts of mathmatics
    and IT which admittedly felt like magic at the time. I soon learned that the
    technology I was using (at the time an amstrad CPC 464) was very outdated and I began
    using MS-QBASIC and got my first windows PC in 1997 loaded with a 450mhz processor
  </p><br>
  <p>
    During this time I was finding that MS-Dos and QBasic was seriously begining to
    fall behind the time, so I went ahead and started looking at MS-Visual basic 6.0
    It was at this time I started to really understand the importance of being able
    to build compiled software which until now I wasn't using
  </p><br>
  <p>
    In 1999 I started studying intermediate and advanced IT which helped
    me to no end understanding the core princibles of Personal Computers and what
    they were realy capable of.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    I spend much of the next few years in college getting my work done and learning
    every piece of information that I could get so I could complete my studies, during
    this time i learned the basics of HTML and started creating my first web-pages
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Upon completing college I started working for a firm that specialised in making
    web-sites which was a massive boon to my ever expanding skill set. unfortunately
    the company went out of business as more and more services were appearing
    offering cheaper bespoke websites using this new thing called CSS and my short time
    working as a web-developer professional was over.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    in 2003 I started working for a classic car company who was a startup who wanted
    a web-page developer and office admin, I snapped this up and thus i became a developer
    again all beit in a much smaller scale, but this time i could develop it as i wanted
    and went straight to work. during my employment here I made my boss aware that I was
    also a software developer and would like to develop for him to save him money from using
    off the shelf software by creating a Bespoke set of programs that I could also link
    to his web-site.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Impressively he agreed for me to do this and this was my first real opportunity
    to stretch my skills to the next level, and it worked i developed a piece of
    software that could help keep check on repairs by staff, sort finaces
    and send new cars for sale directly to their website.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    in 2005 I was given an opportunity to work for a larger company for a better salary
    to maintain and develop new tools for their current web-site but this was no easy
    feat. I agreed to join the company and helped them start a new site which up until 2013
    was still being used but recently they have changed it. it was working here that
    I started to discover many new technologies that I had not updated myself on and
    struggled to grasp them.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    from 2008 I hit a time of hardship and unfortunately lost my job to recession and due
    to my lack of updated skills I couldn't get back in to work, I was at a crossroads
    and started working in stores and amazon just to get by.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    During this time of hardship I would turn to programing for solace developing pieces
    of software using my newly aquired knowledge of c++, I developed a piece of software
    called RPG Builder 3D and it got some notoriety I met someone through this who pitched
    an overly enthusiastic game which got me learning c# and Java. I felt rejuvinated and really
    got a liking back for developing games and software so i went ahead and placed my self
    in university studying computer sciences for which I learned about many of the new
    developments in the IT world and much of the new tools used for software and web sites.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    2015 was a turning point, I began working for the firm I currently still work and developed
    a new web-site for them with a client and staff member section, staff could use this site to
    become a registered member of the site which would allow them to book holidays from work,
    type reports and check current stock of PPE etc in the office.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    2019 was a year where I sat back and started really honing my skills once again rejuvinated
    and ready to show my skills to the world
